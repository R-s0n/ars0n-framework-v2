    <em>üö® Pre-Alpha Release Out now!!  Beta Launch @ DEFCON 33 Bug Bounty Hunting Village!!! üö®</em>
</p>

<p align="center">My full bug bounty hunting methodology built into a single framework!  Automate the most common bug bounty hunting workflows and <em>Earn While You Learn</em>!</p>

<p align="center">The goal of this tool is to eliminate the barrier of entry for bug bounty hunting.  My hope is that someone can pick up this tool and start hunting on day one of their AppSec journey üöÄ</p>

## About

Howdy!  My name is Harrison Richardson, or `rs0n` (arson) when I want to feel cooler than I really am.  The code in this repository started as a small collection of scripts to help automate many of the common Bug Bounty hunting processes I found myself repeating.  Over time, I built these scripts into an open-source framework that helped thousands of people around the world begin their bug bounty hunting journey.  

However, the first implementation of the framework had a wide range of issues.  The majority of the problems were a result of the tool never being designed with the intent of being shared as an open-source project.  So I got to work on a version 2 that would solve these problems and bring my vision to life!

**The Ars0n Framework V2** is designed to be a tool that allows people to start REAL bug bounty hunting against actual targets on day one!  The framework acts as a wrapper around 20+ widely used bug bounty hunting tools and a clever UI design forces the user into a correct hunting methodology.  It is literally impossible to use this tool without going through rs0n's process!  

The results of each tool are stored in a central database and can be used for understanding/visualizing the target company's attack surface.  Each section also includes a "Help Me Learn!" dropdown that includes a lession plan to help the user understand what part of the methodology they are at, what they are trying to acheive, and most importantly the "Why?" behind it.

My hope is that this modular framework will act as a canvas to help share what I've learned over my career to the next generation of Security Engineers!  Trust me, we need all the help we can get!!
