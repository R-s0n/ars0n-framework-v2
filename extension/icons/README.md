# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

The icons should feature the Ars0n Framework branding:
- **Primary Color**: Red/Danger (#dc3545)
- **Theme**: Dark background with red flame or fire symbol
- **Style**: Modern, minimal, professional

### Recommended Design Elements:
- A stylized flame icon in red
- Dark circular or rounded square background
- High contrast for visibility
- Clean, simple design that's recognizable at small sizes

## Temporary Solution

Until custom icons are created, you can:

1. Use any PNG image as a placeholder (rename to icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png)
2. Use an online icon generator to create branded icons
3. Use a graphic design tool like Figma, Canva, or Photoshop to create custom icons
